# theblockchainapi.GetPublicKeyRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**secretRecoveryPhrase** | **String** | The twelve word phrase that can be used to derive many public key addresses. To derive a public key, you need a secret recovery phrase, a derivation path, and an optional passphrase. See our Security section &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;#section/Security\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. | 
**derivationPath** | **String** | Derivation paths are used to derive the public key from the secret recovery phrase. Only certain paths are accepted.  We use \&quot;m/44/501/0/0\&quot; by default, if it is not provided. This is the path that the Phantom and Sollet wallets use. If you provide the empty string \&quot;\&quot; as the value for the derivation path, then we will use the Solana CLI default value. The SolFlare recommended path is \&quot;m/44/501/0\&quot;.  You can also arbitrarily increment the default path (\&quot;m/44/501/0/0\&quot;) to generate more wallets (e.g., \&quot;m/44/501/0/1\&quot;, \&quot;m/44/501/0/2\&quot;, ...). This is how Phantom generates more wallets.

**passphrase** | **String** | PASSPHRASE !&#x3D; PASSWORD. This is NOT your Phantom password or any other password. It is an optional string you use when creating a wallet. This provides an additional layer of security because a hacker would need both the secret recovery phrase and the passphrase to access the output public key. By default, most wallet UI extensions do not use a passphrase. (You probably did not use a passphrase.) Limited to 500 characters.  | [optional] [default to &#39;&#39;]
